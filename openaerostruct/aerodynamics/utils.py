"""
Define the aerodynamic analysis component using a vortex lattice method.

We input a nodal mesh and properties of the airflow to calculate the
circulations of the horseshoe vortices. We then compute the forces, lift,
and drag acting on the lifting surfaces. Currently we can compute the induced
and viscous drag.

    """
    Compute the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrix
    for either solving the linear system or solving for the drag.

    We use a nested for loop structure to loop through the lifting surfaces to
    obtain the corresponding mesh, then for each mesh we again loop through
    the lifting surfaces to obtain the collocation points used to compute
    the horseshoe vortex influence coefficients.

    This creates mtx with blocks corresponding to each lifting surface's
    effects on other lifting surfaces. The block diagonal portions
    correspond to each lifting surface's influencen on itself. For a single
    lifting surface, this is the entire mtx.

    params : dictionary
        OpenMDAO params dictionary for a given aero problem
    surfaces : dictionary
        Dictionary containing all surfaces in an aero problem.
    skip : boolean
        If false, the bound vortex contributions on the collocation point
        corresponding to the same panel are not included. Used for the drag
        computation.
